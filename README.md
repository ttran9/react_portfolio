# React Portfolio

- Demo

  - This react application can be found [here](https://toddtran.com/).

- Some Information:
  - This is a React application that I am making to practice deploying to a remote Linux server and where I will be posting some projects I have created using a variety of programming languages and technologies.
  - Although I could've uploaded this to Heroku I decided to upload this to a remote Linux server because deploying to Heroku works but it takes away having to do basic configuration tasks on a remote Linux (in this case Ubuntu) machine.
